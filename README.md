## SaaSify

SaaSify is a SaaS landing page template built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Requirements

Before installing SaaSify, ensure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Version 18.x or higher
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): Version 9.x or higher (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install --force
```

Note: This project requires React 19 and other modern dependencies. You may see peer dependency warnings, which can be safely ignored.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
